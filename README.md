At <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html">Western Governors University</href>, I am pursuing an affordable ABET-accredited bachelor's degree in computer science through their self-paced online program. Before enrollment, I transferred core credits from my previous degree and completed several ACE-accredited courses in computer science and mathematics, which are required for the degree. I am set to begin my studies at WGU on August 1, 2024, completing the remaining classes required to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
