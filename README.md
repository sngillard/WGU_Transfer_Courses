At <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html" target="_blank">Western Governors University</a>, I am pursuing an affordable ABET-accredited bachelor's degree in computer science through their self-paced online program. Before enrollment, I transferred core credits from my previous degree and completed several ACE-accredited courses in computer science and mathematics, which are required for the degree. I began my studies at WGU on August 1, 2024, to complete the remaining classes required to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

While we are not permitted to publicly share code for WGU assignments, we can share GitLab links to WGU projects with potential employers.

<strong>At WGU, I will take the following courses to complete the degree:</strong>
Version Control, Java Fundamentals, Java Frameworks, Back-End Programming, Advanced Java, Discrete Math II, Linux Foundations, Operating Systems for Programmers, Data Structures and Algorithms II, Business of IT-Applications, Software Engineering, Software Design and Quality Assurance, Computer Science Capstone.

Additionally, I have the option to take new courses starting in January 2025, including:
Advanced AI & Machine Learning, AI Optimization for Computer Science, Practical Applications of Prompt Engineering. Given the growing demand for artificial intelligence skills, I plan to take advantage of these new offerings to expand my knowledge in AI and machine learning.

As of November 2024, I have completed 72% of the requirements for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
