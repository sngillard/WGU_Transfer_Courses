# Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at WGU

At [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html), I am pursuing an affordable ABET-accredited bachelor's degree in computer science through their self-paced online program. My educational journey began after high school with a Bachelor's in Psychology and a Master's in Education. However, in my 30s, I developed a strong interest in technology, sparked by the disruptions of COVID-19. Participating in workshops like [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/43613-sarah-gillard) ignited my passion for coding and led me to transition into computer science.

WGU provides the flexibility to continue my education while drawing on over 10 years of experience in education (working as a teacher, substitute, and aide) as well as time in retail and recruiting. This allows me to balance my career transition into tech with the practical experience I’ve gained in multiple fields.

My interest in computer science has stayed strong even with all the changes in the field since I first started studying. While I’m not sure if I can exclusively focus on coding or web development anymore, given the changes in demand across the industry, I’m deeply curious about the many other paths within computer science and enjoy exploring its constantly evolving areas. Lately, I’ve been especially drawn to artificial intelligence and how it’s shaping the future. I’m open to exploring different roles and excited to keep building skills that let me grow with the field.

Before enrollment at WGU, I transferred core credits from my previous degrees and completed several ACE-accredited courses in computer science and mathematics, which are required for the degree. I began my studies at WGU on August 1, 2024, to complete the remaining classes required to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

## Courses Taken at WGU
As of July 8, 2025, I have completed 87% of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree at WGU. To make this degree as affordable and efficient as possible, I transferred in credits from my previous BS in Psychology and M.Ed. and completed several prerequisite courses through accredited alternative programs. This approach allowed me to focus on the advanced computer science courses necessary for my career path while minimizing the cost of my degree.

### Term 1 (August 2024 - January 2025)
- Version Control - D197  
- Java Fundamentals - D286
- Java Frameworks - D287
- Back-End Programming - D288
- Advanced Java - D387
- Linux Foundations - D281

In January 2025, I decided to switch to the new program track at WGU, which includes additional AI-focused courses. While some of the courses I had already completed are no longer required in the updated program, I am excited to pursue AI & Machine Learning and AI Optimization for Computer Scientists to gain experience and explore this rapidly growing field.

### Term 2 (February 2025 - July 2025)
- Introduction to Computer Science - D684
- Business of IT - Applications - D336
- Software Engineering - D284  
- Operating Systems for Computer Scientists - D686 
- Software Design and Quality Assurance - D480
- Discrete Mathematics II - C960
- Data Structures and Algorithms II - C950

## Remaining Courses
- Introduction to AI for Computer Scientists - D429
- Artificial Intelligence Optimization for Computer Scientists - D682
- Advanced AI and ML - D683
- Computer Science Project Development with a Team (Capstone) - D687

**I hope to complete the program by the end of August 2025.**
