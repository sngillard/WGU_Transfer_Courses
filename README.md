# Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at WGU

At [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html), I am pursuing an affordable ABET-accredited bachelor's degree in computer science through their self-paced online program. My educational journey began after high school with a Bachelor's in Psychology and a Master's in Education. However, in my 30s, I developed a strong interest in technology, sparked by the disruptions of COVID-19. Participating in workshops like [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/43613-sarah-gillard) ignited my passion for coding and led me to transition into computer science.

WGU provides the flexibility to continue my education while drawing on over 10 years of experience in education (working as a teacher, substitute, and aide) as well as time in retail and recruiting. This allows me to balance my career transition into tech with the practical experience I’ve gained in multiple fields.

My interest in computer science has stayed strong even with all the changes in the field since I first started studying. While I’m not sure if I can exclusively focus on coding or web development anymore, given the changes in demand across the industry, I’m deeply curious about the many other paths within computer science and enjoy exploring its constantly evolving areas. Lately, I’ve been especially drawn to artificial intelligence and how it’s shaping the future. I’m open to exploring different roles and excited to keep building skills that let me grow with the field.

Before enrollment at WGU, I transferred core credits from my previous degrees and completed several ACE-accredited courses in computer science and mathematics, which are required for the degree. I began my studies at WGU on August 1, 2024, to complete the remaining classes required to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
